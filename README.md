# MBot_forklift
Welcome to the repository for a Fusion 360 Forklift Design project for the ROB550 course, Fall 2023 at the University of Michigan. This project covers the design aspects of creating a functional forklift model using Fusion 360, using cheap manufacturing techniques, and components found in the lab (motors, fasteners, 3D printers, etc).

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a detailed forklift design that is both functional and realistic. The design process includes:

- Conceptualization and sketching
- 3D modeling of components
- Assembly of parts
- Simulation for movement and load testing

## Design
The design files can be found in the `design` folder. The forklift consists of several components designed to be assembled and simulate real-world operations.

## Video Demonstration
A video demonstration of the forklift simulation is available below:

## Installation Instructions
To view and edit the design files, you need to have Fusion 360 installed on your computer. You can download Fusion 360 from [Autodesk's official website](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview).

## Usage
Clone the repository and navigate to the `design` folder to access the Fusion 360 design files. The files can be opened and edited using Fusion 360.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jneyzaguirre1/MBot_forklift.git
cd MBot_forklift/design
```
